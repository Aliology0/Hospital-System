5- what meant by user defined constructor and its role in initialization

A constructor is a special method that runs automatically when you create an object from a class.
A user-defined constructor is one that you explicitly write and define the values within it.
You can define a default, parameterized or a copy constructor.

Initializes object state: It sets the values of fields or properties when the object is created.
Enforces required values: You can make sure important data is passed at the time of creation.

Why Use a User-Defined Constructor?

To provide a custom way to initialize your class.
To avoid writing repetitive code for setting default values.

6- compare between Array and Linked List

Array:
Structure: A collection of elements stored in contiguous memory locations
Memory allocation: Fixed size (declared at creation)
Types: One-dimensional, multi-dimensional

- Fast at inserting at the end
- Very fast at accessing indices

- slow at inserting at the start/middle
- slow at deleteing at the start/middle

Linked List:
Structure: A sequence of nodes, where each node points to the next one (doubly points at both directions)
Memory allocation: Dynamic size (grows/shrinks as needed)
Types: Singly, doubly, circular linked lists

- fast at inserting at the start/middle
- fast at deleteing at the start/middle

- slow at accessing indices (Because you need to traverse every node)
- slow at inserting at the end
